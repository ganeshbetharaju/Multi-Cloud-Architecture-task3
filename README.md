## Task 3: Multi-Cloud Architecture Design

**Objective:** To design a multi-cloud architecture where services are distributed across two cloud providers to enhance reliability and avoid vendor lock-in.

### 1. Architectural Design and Diagram

The chosen architecture is a **Backup and Disaster Recovery model**. The primary application and its data reside on Amazon Web Services (AWS), while the data backups are replicated to Google Cloud Platform (GCP) for redundancy.

### 2. Components of the Architecture

* **Primary Cloud Provider (AWS):**
    * **Amazon EC2 Instance:** This virtual server hosts the main web application. It handles all user requests and business logic.
    * **Amazon S3 Bucket:** This is the primary object storage for all data generated by the application, such as user uploads, logs, and media files.

* **Secondary Cloud Provider (Google Cloud):**
    * **Google Cloud Storage:** This storage service is used as a secure, cost-effective location for backing up the data from the AWS S3 bucket.

### 3. Interoperability: How the Platforms Connect

The "interoperability" or connection between AWS and Google Cloud is achieved through **data replication**.

A scheduled script or a data transfer service would be configured to run periodically (e.g., daily). This process would connect to the AWS S3 bucket, copy any new or modified data, and transfer it securely over the internet to the Google Cloud Storage bucket. This ensures the backup is always kept up-to-date.

### 4. Benefits of this Multi-Cloud Approach

* **Enhanced Data Durability:** Storing critical data in two separate geographical and structural environments drastically reduces the risk of data loss.
* **Disaster Recovery:** If the primary AWS region or S3 service were to experience a prolonged outage, we could restore the application's data from the backup in Google Cloud.
* **No Vendor Lock-in:** By having a presence and a data copy in another cloud, the organization gains the flexibility to potentially migrate or run services on Google Cloud in the future.
